## Original Requirements

The boss wants to create a feature/plugin/addon for Unity Test Runner - an app for testing games based on Unity engine. The feature includes using AI to match the description of current bugs - issues - to avoid duplicating them. The plugin will also collect data and compare the current found issues to any issues in the past. The plugin will help with the description of the issue based on previous issues and will connect to a bugtracker - database. It will also check grammar errors. The plugin is expected to connect to a testers database too.

## Product Goals

- Create an AI-powered feature for Unity Test Runner to avoid bug duplication
- Develop a system to collect and compare data on current and past issues
- Integrate the feature with a bugtracker and testers database

## User Stories

- As a game developer, I want to avoid duplicating bug reports so that I can streamline my workflow
- As a tester, I want to compare current issues with past ones to identify patterns

## Requirement Analysis

The product requires AI integration for matching bug descriptions, a data collection and comparison system for current and past issues, a connection to a bugtracker and testers database, and a grammar check feature. The requirements are clear and feasible.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop an AI-powered feature to match bug descriptions']
- ['P0', 'Create a system to collect and compare data on current and past issues']
- ['P1', 'Integrate the feature with a bugtracker and testers database']
- ['P1', 'Add a grammar check feature to the plugin']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be clean and intuitive, with a main dashboard displaying current and past issues. There should be a search bar for finding specific bugs, and a separate section for the AI-powered bug matching feature. The grammar check feature can be integrated into the bug report submission form.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific AI technology to be used for bug matching is not specified. Further clarification is needed on how the plugin will connect to the bugtracker and testers database.
